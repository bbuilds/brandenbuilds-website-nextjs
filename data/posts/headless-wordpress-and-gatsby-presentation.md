After building my headless Wordpress blog over at <a href="https://byoungz.com" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Byoungz Digital nomad website</a>, I was offered a slot to do a presnsation at the <a href="https://wpseattle.org/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Seattle WordPress Community</a>. I had a lot of fun talking about my experience and what I learned. You can read my in depth blog post about developing a headless WordPress site at <Link href="/byoungz-headlesswp-gatsby"><a>Headless WordPress and Gatsby</a></Link>.

I had a lot of fun explaining the benefits of using Gatsby and how it can be used to build a headless WordPress site. You can watch the full video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uefnclkjovw" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">WP Seattle Youtube Channel.</a>
